I am writing to express my strong interest in the thesis you are proposing on quantum measure. The topic truly captivates me and aligns well with my interests and part of my academic background.

My interest in pursuing a PhD mainly stems from the experiences I am currently having during my internship, where I find discussions with doctoral students to be extremely stimulating. In fact, I am taking full advantage of this opportunity to pose numerous questions about physics spanning a wide range of topics. Despite occasionally being told that I am annoying, I firmly believe that these discussions are enhancing my understanding of physics.

I am really triggered by the measure problem, since I came in contact for the first time with the postulates of quantum mechanics, realizing there is an ambiguity related to measure.
Then this year I had a class on quantum information theory, where I was presented the density matrix formalism to describe composite systems.
Currently, I am completing an internship in statistical mechanics at Institut Lumiere Matiere in Lyon.Our research centers on investigating spinoidal decomposition, an out-of-equilibrium phenomenon. This process arises when a system transitions from a singular stable phase to two stable phases, typically observed when the temperature falls below the critical value in models like the Ising model. As a consequence, the system undergoes coarsening dynamics, which we analyze looking at the Chan-Allen equation, the simplest model describing domain dynamics. Currently, we are trying to understand how coarsening is affected by changes in the temperature of the system. During my work, I am employing both analytical methods, utilizing multiscale expansions, and numerical approaches, running simulations with a code I developed in C.

Even though I am not currently involved in experimental work during my internship, I am keen on pursuing a Ph.D. project that seamlessly integrates experimental work with theoretical constructs. Given my current focus on studying coarsening dynamics, I believe that the knowledge I have gained and am gaining could be valuable in analyzing experimental data.

Moreover, my academic journey has endowed me with hands-on experimental experience. During the first year of my master's in "Solid State Physics and Quantum Technologies," I engaged in a year-long laboratory experience where I worked extensively with radio-frequency electronics and superconducting devices, such as qubits. This experience provided me with hands-on expertise, ranging from cable assembly to sensor programming and data analysis.

I hope you appreciate my background. I am truly eager to pursue a Ph.D. after my internship, as I wish to remain in a dynamic environment similar to the one I have found in Lyon.

Thank you for considering my application.

Eager to meet your team,

Rocco Suanno
