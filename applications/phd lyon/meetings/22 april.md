Find a way to talk about universality: close to the critical point all systems in the same class we expect behave the same.
We keep H=0 in order to study the universality class of Ising with H=0; we do that because no one has ever researched in this direction (changing only Temperature) and this case is simpler than the one with H (simpler differential equation)


- The TDGL comes from working near the critical point so T close to Tc.
BUT in a magnetic system we see the same dynamics under the Tc. So what can we say?

FeAl alloy of Chan Allen articles may be an example, but I have to understand the experimental figures.

Shuld I calculate what is the coefficient multipling (T-Tc) in C in order to compare TDGL with Montecarlo at the same temperature?
