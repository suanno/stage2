In the TDGL equation we model spinodal decomposition with a double well potential.
This means that the smallest fluctuation is sufficient to drive the system from the homogeneous phase (that is the maximum), to one of the stable phases.

Then the equation comes from using this potential in the Landau Ginzburg Free energy.
And then we write an equation for non-conservative dynamics, using this expression of the free energy.


-----------------

In an **overdamped oscillator**, you can neglect the **inertial term** in Newton's equation and you find this equation for the velocity.
In the same fashion, you say that if the dynamics is **non conservative**, then you have this equation for the order parameter.
