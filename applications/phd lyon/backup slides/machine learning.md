# Difference between RL and GA
They are two machine learning schemes, but they work differently.
RL is inspired by how you train a dog. So you have an enviroment (the trainer) and an agent (the dog). The agent makes an action on the enviroment and the enviroment gives a positive reward if he likes the action or a negative one if he doesn't.
Then the algorithm maximises the total reward of the whole process.

GA is inspired by natural selection. You have an optimization problem and you generate random possible solutions. Then you select the best one and you generate the new possible solutions by breeding and mutating them. And you do natural selection again.




# Machine learning
For machine learning we mean algorithms that recognize patterns in a dataset and then use those patterns to make prediction outside dataset.
