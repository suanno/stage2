So, what I mean by multiple scale expansion?

We look for a solution of the equation that is a function of x and t. But as in principle different phenomenas occurr at different time-scales (some are faster than others), we define **new time variables** to describe each phenomena, where $\epsilon$ is a small parameter. Then, we look for solution that are function not only of x and t, but of all those new variables and we expand in powers of $\epsilon$.
By equating each order, we find new equations to solve to get the terms of the expansion.

### What is $\epsilon$
It is a small parameter defined differently if C is slow or fast oscillating.
In both cases, the limit of $\epsilon\rightarrow 0$ corresponds to the slow or fast oscillating limit.

### Only one lenght-scale
Empirically, this system has only one lenghtscale, that evolves as a power law of time.
So we do not introduce additional space variables.

### Strenght of the method
The strenght is that after introducing the new variables, we will not have anymore just one solution.
So to have one solution you have to impose some constraints on the dependendance of the terms of the expansion on the new variables.
And you can choose the constraints to simplify the equations.

### Non-rigorous method
There is no rigorous proof that using this method and imposing constraints to simplify the equations will lead to **approximate** solution. But you can always verify this by numerically solving the equation, that is another way of finding approximate solutions.
