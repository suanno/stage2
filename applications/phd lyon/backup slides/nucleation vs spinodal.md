Spinodal decomposition is modeleld by a double well potential.
The maximum is the homogeneous phase and there is **no barrier** to reach the two stable phases (that correspond to the presence or not of a monolayer).
Instead, in the nucleation and growth, there is an energy barrier that (thermal) fluctuations have to overcome, to start the growth of the island.

### Energy balance
You pay energy to form an interface between the island and the substrate, while you gain it by depositing matter from the gas phase.
Then, if the deposited material is different than the substrate, you also pay energy due to the bending of bonds between the island and the surface.
This balance becomes convenient only after a critical size of the island. Then its growth starts.

### Visual differences
In spinodal decomposition, from the first steps of the dynamics, you see an interconnected pattern.
While in the first stages of nucleation and growth, you see the centres of nucleation, that only then can grow and merge forming an interconnected patter.

So while the nucleation happens in some points of the space, the spinodal decomposition is delocalized.
