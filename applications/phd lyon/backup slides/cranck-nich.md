To understand what is the method, we have to consider the conventional ways of solving a differential equation numerically, so the explicit and implicit euler methods.
The cranck nicholson method is an alternative that consists in avereging the formulas of the explicit and implicit methods.

Because this method has better affinity with the equation that we solve. 

We can see this in an example, where we consider the evolution of a flat solution (so no space dependance) under oscillatori C(t).
If the average of C is zero, we expect the state to decay as a power law of time, but the Euler methods show a saturation or an exponential decay.
The Cranck Nicholson instead shows the right asymptotic.
