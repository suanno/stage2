Empirically (but maybe there are rigorous results with renormalization group) there is only one lenghtscale in the system.
And this reasoning suggests that this scale evolves as a power law of time.


### Scale-invariance
The system is scale invariant at long times **for large scale features**.
This means that, by rescaling ALL the lenghts, you will not see the same morphology.
Large scale features have the same lenghtscale (so they are proportional with constant in time factors), but there is **another lenghtscale** for small scale features.
The two lenghtscale are:
- Large scale: size of domains
- Small scale: width of the interface (we put this to 1, so the $\epsilon$ in $\kappa = \epsilon K_1$ tells how small the curvature is **respect to** the width. What matters is alway the ratio between different scales, the absolute values have no meaning)
