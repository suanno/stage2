Empirically there is only one lenghtscale in the system.
And this reasoning suggests that this scale evolves as a power law of time.

### What means having only one scale?
This means that if you rescale all the lenghts by this scale, you will see the same dynamics.
Precisely the rescaled morphology will not depend on time, on average (statistically average over the initial states).
