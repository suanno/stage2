My passion for physics stems from a deep desire to understand fundamental phenomena in detail, avoiding simplistic explanations. During my master’s at the University of Milano Bicocca, I became particularly interested in out-of-equilibrium dynamics at crystal surfaces, inspired by Prof. Francesco Montalenti’s lectures on molecular dynamics simulations. After a precious discussion with him, he suggested I undertake my final internship with Prof. Olivier Pierre Louis in Lyon.

From the experiences I’m currently living cduring my internship, I decided to pursure a PhD mainly because I find discussions with doctoral students to be extremely sti-
mulating. In fact, I am taking full advantage of this opportunity to get useful insights for
my internship and to pose general questions about physics.
During my internship, I developed analytical and numerical tools that enhanced our unders-
tanding of how the morphology of bidimensional systems, accounting for example for a monolayer on a crystal facet, are affected by temperature changes over time. However, what truly excites me is the prospect of investigating how tri-dimensional morpology of crytsal surfaces can be controlled. With the tools I have already created, it would be much easier to conduct research in this area, which could have significant practical applications.
Additionally, I spent the past few months studying the theoretical background of my in-
ternship’s work, so I am confident that I am prepared to make significant contributions to
the field with this PhD.
