My passion for physics stems from a deep desire to understand fundamental phenomena in detail, avoiding simplistic explanations. During my master’s at the University of Milano Bicocca, I became particularly interested in out-of-equilibrium dynamics at crystal surfaces, inspired by Prof. Francesco Montalenti’s lectures on molecular dynamics simulations. After a precious discussion, he suggested to move in Lyon to do my las internship with Prof. Olivier Pierre Louis.
My current internship experiences have solidified my decision to pursue a PhD, as discussions with doctoral students have been incredibly stimulating and insightful.
During my internship, I developed analytical and numerical tools that enhanced our unders-
tanding of how the morphology of bidimensional systems, accounting for example for a monolayer on a crystal facet, are affected by temperature changes over time. However, what truly excites me is the prospect of investigating how tri-dimensional morpology of crytsal surfaces can be controlled and this is the topic of the proposed PhD. With the tools I have already prepared, it would be much easier to conduct research in this area.
Additionally, I spent the past few months studying the theoretical background of my in-
ternship’s work, so I am confident that I am prepared to make significant contributions to
the field with this PhD.
