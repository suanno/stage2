- **Setup**: Fluid microchannel, confined by two silicon plates in gravity direction of $18\mu m$.
- **Mixture**: A solution of the colloids in water is mixed with a solution of xanthan polymer. Glycerine is added to slow the coarsening.
- **Colloids**: **Fluorescent labelled** PMMA particles, they are spherical of radius 110nm.
- **Phase separation**: The solution is steered and then left resting. The separation occurs while it is resting.
- **Phases**: We have two phases, that are labelled as a liquid and a gas phases, the difference is in concentration of colloids (of 1kg/m3).
The ratio between the two phases is conserved during the coarsening and it is 70:30 (liquid:gas).
- **Dark** phase is the gas phase.
- **Measuring device**: Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), It is an optical microscope that enables Optical sectioning, so measure inner layers of the sample.
The images we have are of the central layer (so it is a bulk layer)
- **2D**: We have a 2D image because we're looking at a section. But the domains we see are the sections of cylinders bridging the plates of the tube.
One of the two phases completely wets the plates.
