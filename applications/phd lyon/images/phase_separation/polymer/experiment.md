The images are obtained like this
- **Electron microscope** images
- **Black** is concentrated polymer phase (you see that from the picture where you see nucleation)
- **Tecnique**: The sample is quenched at a controlled temperature and time, then it is istantaneously frozen in liquid nitrogen to stop the domain dynamics. Then the sample is etched to get a thin layer to put in the microscope.
- **Solution**: 10% in weight polymer in a solution of caprolactose.
* **Polymer**: Poly(2,6-dimethyl-l,4-phenylene oxide)

**Typo in the article ?**: In the article the 30s and 60s quenched at 90^C look inverted. The coarsening brings to bigger domains when time passes!
