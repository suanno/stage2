### Genetic algorithm
You have an optimization problem, so a quantity to optimize.
Then you think to a candidate solution as a set of properties, that you can modify.
You start with many candidate solutions with random properties.
Then you do _natural selection_ selecting only the candidates with the highest value for the quantity to optimize. You then create the new generation starting from those individuals and randomly modifying some properties.
