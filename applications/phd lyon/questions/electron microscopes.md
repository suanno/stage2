Differences between SET and TEM and then
Differences between AFM and STM
And resolutions of the two kinds of microscopes

**Note**: SEM means scanning, but it is always used to refer to **Reflection** microscope. All microscopes (both the reflection: SEM and the transmission TEM) scan in order to obtain an image and not only what elements there are (the scan tells even where they are)

- AFM: Atomic force microscope, a sharp tip (with one atom at the end) moves along the surface. The tip does not penetrate the sample because atoms cannot penetrate each other. If there is a step on the path of the tip, as the atoms cannot penetrate, the tip moves above the step.
To see this vertical movement of the tip, there is a mirror on the top of the tip and the reflection will change depending on the height.

    Measures: morphology of the surface at atomic scale. But not the elements.

- STM: Like the AFM, but the height is measured with a feedback mechanism that keeps the tunneling current fixed.

- SEM: Scanning electron microscope (even Reflection electron microscope), it shots electron on the surface and measures the **reflected** ones.

    **Surface morphology**: The electron can do elastic scattering, so it does not loose energy (and even the parallel component of momentum doesn't change for simmetry of the surface).
    The angle of scattering does not depend on the height (morphology atomic height), but the point of scattering, and so where the scattered electron hits the screen yes.
    
    To explore the surface, you need 50-100eV slow electrons, or incline the electron source.

    **Elements**: Some (fast) electrons do Auger effect, so they remove core electrons, then a valence electron falls there and then the energy gained is used to explell a valence electron (sometimes this happens instead of emitting a photon).
    Depending on the energy of this electron, you find the element.

    You have resolution of 1nm, 3D image of the surface and you know the chemical elements that constitute it.

-  TEM: Transmission electron microscope.

    You need a **thin** sample, because you look at the transmitted electrons. So you need to take a slice of the sample.
    It makes a 2D picture of an inner layer of the sample, measuring the elements composing it.
    But if you use it for the surface, the image is 2D, instead of the SEM where it's 3D. So it is usually not applied for seeking for surface morphology.

- LEEM: Low energy electron microscope, it is like a SEM, but electron are slowed down and sent vertically, instead of using a glazing angle. There is a way of measuring the height like this, so you see atomic steps.

    Advantages:
    
    The resolution is lower than STM. It captures nanoscale features and does not see the single atoms. So if the sample is big, the time needed for a scan is way lower. And this is relevant as we want real time images of a dynamic process.

    Then, while in SEM (Reflection) the glazing angle makes the spatial resolution lower in one direction. Here the beam is vertical instead.
