# My interests
I'm curios about physiscs in general. I like the process of modelling a real problem into a simple abstract problem.
I'm enjoying working in an office with doctoral students, because I can make them a lot of questions about different topics in physics. Mostly are fundamental questions, not on application. I feel my knowledge of physics is improving a lot, even if they say I'm annoying sometimes.
I am very critical and I totally do not like to take things for granted.
I like challenges, especially the ones you can approach with the aid of a computer.
I'm very curios about the work of the others, especially on how they are approaching their problems.


# Internship
Currently i'm in an internship in the field of statistical mechanics at Institut Lumiere Matiere in Lyon (France).
We're studying an out of equilibrium phenomena that is spinoidal decomposition. This is the kind of phase separation you see in the Ising model when you quench it under the critical temperature. But you see this behaviour even in a 2D lattice-gas system (Surface where you can change only the first layer in contact with a gas with atoms that can attach/detach).
The equation governing spinoidal decomposition when the dynamics is dissipative/non-conservative (so the amounts of each of the two phases are non conserved) is called Chan-Allen in mathematics or Time-Dependent Gitzburg-Landau equation in physics. It is a non-linear partial differential equation.
It can be derived from the Gitzburg-Landau theory, so it works great around the critical point (critical temperature in the Ising Model) and it describes an universal dynamics of systems that share the same simmetries of Ising model, at least close to the critical temperature.

We're studying how the dynamics of the domains responds to change in temperature over time. Because our goal is to understand if and how much we can control the shapes and sizes of domains by only changing temperature in time.

We're both working analytically, by making multiscale expansions that enable to study the dynamics in some extremal regimes (e.g. fast or slowly changing temperature) and numerically, with a code that i wrote.

# Bachelor thesis
I worked on the simplest hamiltonian chaotical system, known as the standard map. This system is very interesting, because the dynamics is governed by just one parameter that you can tune to have non-chaotic dynamics to chaotic one.
In this thesis I used this discrete time map to generate a sequence of values and then check quantitatively if the sequence satisfies a theorem that is demostrated for random-walks with independent jumps: The Sparre-Andersen theorem.
This is not obvious, as the element of 
the sequence are not independent.

# Master Laboratory of quantum technologies
I worked in a low temperature physics laboratory with a cryostat that reached in its lower point millikelvin temperature. In the cryostat we mounted a radio-frequency trasmission line
that served to readout the state of a superconducting quantum bit (qubit). My goal was to improve
the accuracy of the readout, by using a superconducting parametric amplifier .

# Bachelor Laboratory of computational physics
I learned basic computational methods, mainly for interpolation, optimization, and numerical
integration. Then, I gained experience with Markovian processes, random walks on graphs, and
some methods for numerically solving the Schrödinger Equation.


# Bachelor
I have a bachelor degree in physics. During my last year I even had a class on Robotics and Automatics.
I had a very intense class on automatics, where I learned how to find and classify stabilities in linear systems. Then I learned how to control linear systems, so how to design the control function. Mainly the focus was on feedback control. I both studied continuos time and discrete time systems.

# Github
During my master I used to write codes to get a better understanding of some topics: landau levels, adiabatic theorem and some algortithm of quantum computing. Then I have a repository where i write well organized notes on topics of mathematics and physics to which I recurr frequently.

# Master
After a bachelor degree in physics, I started a master in "Solid state physics and quantum technologies".
