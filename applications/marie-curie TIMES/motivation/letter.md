I want to express my strong interest in the doctoral position advertised within the TIMES doctoral network.

My interest in pursuing a PhD mainly stems from the experiences I'm currently living during my internship, where I found the discussions with doctoral students to be really stimulating. In fact, I am taking full advantage of this opportunity to pose numerous questions about physics spanning a wide range of topics. Even though they tell that I'm annoying, I firmly believe that engaging in discussions with fellow students within the group is enhancing my understanding of physics.

I am deeply intrigued by this PhD project because I am really fascinated by collective phenomenas. I have a strong inclination towards the study of quantum phenomena from a theoretical perspective. The prospect of explaining macroscopic effects through a quantum microscopic theory excites me greatly.
Furthermore, I thrive in environments where I can work simultaneously on both numerical and analytical aspects. Currently, I am engaged in this dual approach during my internship, where I utilize numerical simulations to gain valuable insights that aid in the development of our analytical theory.

During my master's studies in condensed matter physics, I studied many particle systems, with a particular emphasis on electron and photon gases. While learning the fundamentals of density functional theory, I was introduced to collective excitations and correlations in electron systems.
A considerable portion of my time during my master's program was dedicated to studying superconductivity. Through a combination of theoretical coursework and hands-on laboratory experience, I gained knowledge about quantum materials and their applications, especially in quantum computing.
In fact, I had the opportunity of working for a whole year with a superconducting qubit and a superconducting parametric amplifier, during my master's laboratory experience.

Currently, as an internship student, I am engaged in theoretical research in non-linear dynamics and control theory under the mentorship of Olivier Pierre-Louis, at Institute Lumiere Matiere in Lyon. We're investigating the dynamics of the Time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation, that is a partial differential equation describing an out-of-equilibrium phenomena: spinodal decomposition in the non-conservative (dissipative) regime. The equation provides an accurate continuous description of the dynamics of the Ising model following a sudden change in temperature below the critical point.

I am confident that my background in condensed matter physics, coupled with the experience I'm gaining in theoretical research and numerical simulations, makes me the right candidate for this position.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Rocco Suanno.
