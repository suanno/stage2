I am writing to express my strong interest in the thesis you are proposing on coarsening in foams. The topic really captures me, and aligns with my academic background.

My interest in pursuing a PhD mainly stems from the experiences I'm currently having during my internship, where I find discussions with doctoral students to be extremely stimulating. In fact, I am taking full advantage of this opportunity to pose numerous questions about physics spanning a wide range of topics. Despite being told sometimes that I'm annoying, I firmly believe that these discussions are enhancing my understanding of physics.

Currently, I am doing an internship in statistical mechanics at Institut Lumiere Matiere in Lyon. Our research focuses on an out-of-equilibrium phenomena called specifically spinoidal decomposition. It is a kind of phase separation phenomenon that occurs when you have transition from having a single stable phase to two stable phases. For example when you bring temperature under the critical value in the Ising model.
The resulting dynamics is coarsening and we're studying the simplest model describing the dynamics of the domains: the Chan-Allen equation.
Now we're trying to understand how the coarsening is affected by changes in the temperature of the system.
During my work, I'm employing both analytical methods, utilizing multiscale expansions, and numerical approaches, running simulations with a code I developed in C.

Even if I'm not doing an experimental internship, I'd like to pursue a Ph.D. project that seamlessly integrates experimental work with theoretical constructs. Then, as my internship I'm studying coarsening dynamics, I think that the knowledge I have and I'm gaining could help in analyzing what we see in the experiments.

Moreover, my academic journey has endowed me with hands-on experimental experience. During the first year of my master's in "Solid state physics and quantum technologies", I engaged in an year laboratory experience. I worked extensively with radio-frequency electronics and superconducting devices (transmon qubits), so I acquired some hands-on expertise, spanning from cable assembly to sensor programming and data analysis.

Hope you can appreciate my background. I really want to do a phd after my internship, because I want to stay in a dynamic enviroment like the one that I found in Lyon.

Thank you for considering my application.

Eager to meet your team,

Rocco Suanno
