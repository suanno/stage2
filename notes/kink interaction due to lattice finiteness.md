The lattice of the simulation is finite, this brings to "interaction" of the two kinks that is purely an effect of the lattice finiteness.

As our analytical theory is about infinite lattice, we cannot compare analytcal and experimental results where there is this interaction.

Experimentally the transition to this regime (where any comparison makes no sense) is enhanced by a **saturation of the kink's width**.
