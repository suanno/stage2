# Spinoidal decomposition
It is the phenomena by which system that
- has a scalar order parameter $m(\mathbf{x})$
- and is _well described_ by a **double well free energy**
starting from the phase corresponding to the unstable point (we have this phase every point **x**) transitate to the two stable phases.
As the order parameter is a field and not a number, you have rising of two coexist phases. So you can say this is a kind of **phase separation** process.

As the initial phase **is an unstable** point in the free energy, **even the smallest fluctuation** of the _order parameter_ at the point **x** is sufficient to make the system have a transition _in the neighborood of **x**_ (to climb down the free energy function).
Then, as at any point we expect to have a fluctuation of $m(x)$ from 0 (even arbitrarily small) and the different parts of the system interact, it is non-trivial to know how $m(\mathbf{x})$ will evolve known the initial state.

But the important concept is that **you need** _spatial **fluctuations**_ of $m(x)$ (deviation from m=0 _along the size_ of the system) to have the **phase separation**; but the fluctuation can be even arbitrarily small (so you match always the required conditions).
We say that this transition is **spontaneous**, as you do not need strong fluctuation (but you need they exist!)

The ising model with nearest neighbours interactions (both with or without magnetic field) goes through a spinodal decomposition under the critical temperature.
This you can state because the system is described by a double well free energy **under, but close** to the critical temperature.

# Nucleation and successive growth
In this physical phenomena, the system goes from a phase that is a **metastable** point in the free energy function, towards two phases that are stable.
In this case, you need **strong fluctuations** of the order parameter (respect to zero and along the system) to overcome the energy barrier.
This is still a phenomena of phase separation, **but not spontaneous**.

# Miscibility gap
A miscibility gap is a region in a phase diagram for a mixture of components where the mixture exists as two or more phases (**coexistence**).

# As-cast alloy
When the melted alloy is poured in the cast and cooled (without special cooling technique).
In a casting process the cooling rate is fast and so bubbles of the other phase are trapped in the other.
If the cooling was slow, you will see a phase separation in just two domains.
