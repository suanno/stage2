# Introduction: Phase separation phenomenas

## Oil and water
Put water and olive in a glass and try to steer it. You will see immediately a phase separation between the two liquids.
(Maybe vinaigrette if we find good images)

But phase separation is not important only in the kitchen!

## Polymer solution
Here we can see an hoogeneous solution with an high concentration of a polymer.

Quenching at a lower temperature we see the rising of the high and poor concentrated phases.

## Binary alloy
Here instead we have two binary alloys just after casting, here the two phases differ on the concentration of the two components.
As casting is slow, you can see there are domains of one phase trapped in the other.

## Colloids
Here we see a solution of colloids in a $\mu$-channel, that goes in a phase-separation process. Here the white phase has less concentration of colloids.
